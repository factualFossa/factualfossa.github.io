"Nocturnal Lagophthalmos is the inability to close the eyelids during sleep", [says Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagophthalmos). "It may reduce the quality of sleep, cause exposure-related symptoms or, if severe, cause corneal damage." 

Not to cats. They sleep with their eyes open in order to be able to react quickly to a possible threat. Even though there are no threats in our apartment. So I consider it a sign of neurosis.
