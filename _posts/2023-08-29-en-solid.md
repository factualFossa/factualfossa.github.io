Solid, short for "Solidarnost" (Serbian for "solidarity") in Serbian, is a nickname for a residential complex consisting of four units located at the entrance of the city of Smederevo, Serbia, from the capital city of Belgrade. Constructed in the 1970s in a brutalist architectural style, it remains the tallest and most iconic residential building in Smederevo. Here is a  snapshot showcasing one of its protruding balconies, which intriguingly contrasts with the overall facade of the building.
