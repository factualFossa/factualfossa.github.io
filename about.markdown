### Welcome to my website!
I'm Igor, and I maintain this platform as a space to share my writings, photography, and useful information that I come across. 

### Contact
If you'd like to get in touch with me, the recommended methods are through app [Signal](https://signal.org/) or via email. Here are my personal and work numbers and adresses, respectively:

You can also DM me over at [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/capturamundi/) or [Tumblr](https://capturamundi.blog/), but I can't promise I'll answer in a timely manner.

### Supporting my work  
Thank you for visiting! Work shared here is made with love. I am not doing it for the sake of profit, but if you find it useful, I would appreciate your support. At the end, money and gifts are powerful motivators, right? Or you can simply say hi, that would be even better!
