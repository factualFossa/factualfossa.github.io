# Welcome to my website!
I'm Igor, and I maintain this platform as a space to share my writings, photography, and useful information that I come across. 

# Contact
If you'd like to get in touch with me, the recommended methods are:
- [Signal](https://signal.org/) - phone number `MDYzODM0MDM1Mg==` (decode with base64 to get the number)
- email igorv at duck dot com

You can also DM me over at [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/capturamundi/), but I can't promise I'll answer in a timely manner.
