## What I am doing right now

Here is a list of projects I am currently involved in. Please note that some of them are *active*, while others may be *inactive*, temporarily abandoned for various reasons. Additionally, projects labeled as *"experimental"* are ones I am pursuing without overthinking, allowing for trial and error.

### Active

- **Captura Mundi Photography** (*experimental*) is an endeavor aimed at capturing and sharing photographs that deviate from the typical images commonly published by photographers. The work shared on social media platforms such as [Tumblr](https://capturamundi.blog) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/capturamundi/) features photographs that fall between the highly polished and meticulously curated shots we photographers often boast about. The emphasis is on capturing the dynamic movement of the world around me, with a particular focus on intriguing details and patterns.
